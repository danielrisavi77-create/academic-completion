# Academic Completion

Working repository for the third Academic Suite product: a **policy-aware academic completion system**.

## Product boundaries

- **Academic Completion:** knows where the academic project stands, what blocks it and what should happen next.
- **Katedra:** Croatian academic content and writing assistance.
- **Lekta:** deterministic verification of the actual document.

The central product primitive here is **project state**, not chat.

## Current status

**Epic 2 — Typed Project State**

The repository now has a typed domain foundation for project identity, stages, authority, tasks, mentor evidence, Lekta lifecycle, events and a pure state reducer. The production database adapter, Completion Scan, policy resolver, AI execution, Stripe and cross-product integrations remain intentionally deferred.

## Canonical product docs

See `docs/product/`.

Epic implementation notes live under `docs/architecture/`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Validation:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
npm test
```

CI additionally audits production dependencies at high severity.
